I'm currently an undergraduate student at the College of Wooster, double-majoring in computer science and mathematics. My special interests are in cybersecurity and cryptography. I will be working as a Software Engineering Intern at Intuit this coming summer 2017 in Mountain View, California.

Because I'm not much of a web designer, this personal website is built based on the Indigo Jekyll template posted [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes). A lot of thanks to this theme's author and the Jekyll team!
