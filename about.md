I'm currently a Red teamer at Microsoft, dumping lsass and browser cookies to give my cats a better life. Before that I was an undergraduate student at the College of Wooster, double-majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My special interests are in cybersecurity; my most current tinkering itch is hardware hacking and IoT.

Because I'm not much of a web designer, this personal website is built based on the Indigo Jekyll template posted [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes). A lot of thanks to this theme's author and the Jekyll team!
